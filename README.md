# odoo14-releases


Odoo releases in a daily way, looks there is not much method to track what's new and what's the diff b/w two odoo releases. 
This repo is to check in each odoo14 daily release as a commit of this repo, so that you can easily track what's the diff, via git tools.

Of course, this is for odoo14 community releases, not odoo14 enterprise. ^_^
